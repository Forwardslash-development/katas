# Kata

A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps programmers hone their skills through practice and repetition.

In 1999, the term was used by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer,[1] in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. The concept was implemented by Laurent Bossavit and Emmanuel Gaillot who talked about it at XP2005 in Sheffield (UK).[2] Following this conference, Robert C. Martin described the concept and initial usages in his article "The Programming Dojo".[3]
